# Introduction
A plug-in module for the module [Token Action HUD Core](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-action-hud-core) which adds support for the [Old-School Essentials](https://github.com/vttred/ose).

If you want to learn how to use Token HUD, please check this wiki [Token HUD tutorials](https://github.com/Larkinabout/fvtt-token-action-hud-core/wiki/How-to-Use-Token-Action-HUD).

## Behaviour reminders from HUD Core

- The Image of the items can be displayed by selecting 'Display Icons' in the HUD Core settings.
- Right clicking will open the item's window by selecting 'Open Item Sheet on Right-Click' in the HUD Core settings (right-clicking on a pool name will do nothing).
- Some users might prefer to enable the 'Click to Open Categories' in the HUD Core Settings, so that hovering over HUD category names doesn't automatically open the sub-menu.

## Installation

It can be installed by searching in Foundry's module installer, or by directly entering the following URL:

https://github.com/mrcomac/token-action-hud-ose/releases/latest/download/module.json

## Images
The images in `styles/img` are inspired in the actor sheet attributes.
